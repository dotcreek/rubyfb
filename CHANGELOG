add new class ProcedureCall - representing firebird stored procedure
add prepare_call() function to the Rubyfb::Connection class - returning ProcedureCall object
add execute_procedure(procedure_name, parameter_values) function to the RubyfbAdapter class

rename top module to Rubyfb - this breaks the "drop in" compatibility with FireRuby,
but simple search and replace should do the work

Add binary build rake task - binpkg
