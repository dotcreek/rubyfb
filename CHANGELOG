v0.5.9 ==
Fix multibyte string handling for BLOB parameters
Pipe up BLOB encoding when converting to string, or iterating over segments

v0.5.8 ==
Merge duplicated code in transaction.execute() and connection.execute()
Make #fetch() *always* return nil if #exhausted? - pilcrow/look-before-you-leap
Add Fb1.5 compatible arel adapter - at least to some extent
Some words of caution here - the Fb1.5 arel implementation will yield WRONG results with union selects
The Fb15 compatibility mode is turned on by setting Rubyfb::Options.fb15_compat = true in your initialization code
Pipe up field encoding into Ruby 1.9 strings - fix github issue #3
The mapping table from firebird to ruby character set names contains some common character sets,
but is far from complete. The mapping table can be extended/altered in your initializers like this:
Rubyfb::Options.charset_name_map['FIREBIRD_CHARSET_NAME']='RUBY_CHARSET_NAME'

v0.5.7 ==
arel-2.0.7 compatibility - use node.expr for limit/offset clauses
activesupport-3.0.3+ compatibility require_library_or_gem location changed

v0.5.6 ==
Fix rubyforge issue #28870 - by simplifying the Exception class ;) 
Fix rubyforge issue #28860 - rubyfb_adapter.rb and local files as proposed by Leonid Myravjev (asm)
Merge pilcrow-scale branch - introduce column_scale() methods in ResultSet/Row classes thanks to Mike Pomraning (pilcrow)
Drop old unit test suite

v0.5.5 ==
Ruby 1.9 compatibility
Initial Rails 3 support
!!!WARNING!!!
Rails 3 support uses derived tables (Firebird server >= 2.0)
!!!WARNING!!!
DevKit build support (see https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit) thanks to Alex Vangelov
updated test suite

v0.5.4 ==
add configurable boolen domain and boolean name match patterns
fix scale handling for view columns
extconf.rb - replace PLATFORM with RUBY_PLATFORM

v0.5.3 ==
rename top module to Rubyfb
!!!WARNING!!!
this change breaks the "drop in" compatibility with FireRuby if FireRuby module name 
was explicitly used. Simple search and replace should do the work

RubyfbAdapter - add support for :sql_role_name connection option
Add new class ProcedureCall - representing firebird stored procedure
Add prepare_call() function to the Rubyfb::Connection class - returning ProcedureCall object
Add execute_procedure(procedure_name, parameter_values) function to the RubyfbAdapter class
